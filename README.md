# Ultimate Calculator App

Hey there! Welcome to the **Ultimate Calculator App**! üéâ We made this app as part of a class project, and it‚Äôs designed to help with all kinds of math ‚Äì from basic calculations to more advanced functions like square roots Whether you're working on homework, a project, or just need to do some quick math, this app has you covered. Plus, it lets you store values in memory, set your own precision, and do math with any type of number!

## üöÄ Features:
- **Basic Math**: Add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Simple stuff, but super useful!
- **Advanced Functions**: Need a square root? O We‚Äôve got you covered.
- **Memory Functions**: Store numbers in memory, add or subtract them, and clear it all out when you're done.
- **Precision Control**: Want your results to have more decimal places? Set the precision to anywhere from 0 to 10.
- **Flexible Input**: It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre working with integers, floats, or doubles ‚Äì we handle them all!

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use:
1. **Clone the Repo**:
   - First, grab the project using: 
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/jascha10/Calculator-App.git
     ```
   
2. **Run the App**:
   - Open the project in your IDE (we used IntelliJ, but anything works).
   - Run `Testbench.java` to see how the calculator works. It‚Äôll show you a bunch of different operations.

3. **Play Around**:
   - Test the basic operations like `add()`, `subtract()`, `multiply()`, and `divide()`.
   - Try out memory functions with `memoryAdd()`, `memorySubtract()`, and `clearMemory()`.
   - Don‚Äôt forget to mess with the precision! Use `setPrecision()` to change how many decimal places you want.
   - Want to do more advanced stuff? Go ahead and use the square root
