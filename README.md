# Calculator App - Java OOP

## Project Overview
This project is a simple **Calculator App** built using **Java** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. The calculator can do basic math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also has advanced features, including square roots and memory functions to store and manipulate values. The app allows you to control how many decimal places the results show (precision), making it more flexible.

The goal of this project was to practice important Java OOP concepts like interfaces, abstract classes, inheritance, and generics.

## Features
- **Basic Math Operations**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Advanced Math**: Calculate square roots (e.g., `√1600`).
- **Memory Functions**: Add, subtract, and clear memory.
- **Precision**: Set the number of decimal places for the output (from 0 to 10).

## OOP Concepts Used
This project helps practice the following key Java OOP concepts:
- **Interfaces**: Define the structure of operations.
- **Abstract Classes**: Provide a base for other classes to build on.
- **Generics**: Handle different types of numbers (like integers and decimals).
- **Inheritance**: Extend basic functionality and add more features.
- **Polymorphism**: Use methods in different classes to achieve similar results.

## How It Works
- **Basic Operations**: You can perform simple math calculations such as adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing numbers.
- **Advanced Operations**: You can calculate square roots (e.g., `√1600`) and set the precision for how many decimal places the calculator displays.
- **Memory Functions**: The app lets you store results in memory, subtract from memory, or clear it completely.
